# Sourced by airflow_demo.sh (and usable standalone) to configure a local
# Airflow 3.x instance pointed at this repo's airflow_automation/airflow_dags/, backed by the
# local `airflow_ngt` Postgres role/database (LocalExecutor needs row-level
# locking, which SQLite doesn't support -- see README.md's Airflow setup
# section for how that role/database was created).
#
# This is the Airflow-*specific* half of the live-test setup -- infrastructure
# env vars only (executor, DB, DAGs folder, auth). The engine-agnostic half
# (scratch env location, fake toolchain bootstrap) lives in scenario-player/sim_env.sh,
# sourced below; demo-specific wiring (fake OMS/EOS/CMSSW toolchain env vars)
# lives in airflow_demo.sh itself, same split scenario-player/sim_env.sh documents.
#
# Usage: source airflow_automation/airflow_demo/airflow_env.sh

# shellcheck disable=SC1091

# Named distinctly from a pre-existing Airflow 2.x install rather than
# reusing its AIRFLOW_HOME/database in place -- an in-place major-version
# upgrade is real work Airflow supports, but not something worth doing for a
# disposable dev/demo instance; a fresh, separately-named one sidesteps a
# schema mismatch without touching (or needing) whatever was there before.
